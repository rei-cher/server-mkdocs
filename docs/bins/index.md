# Access BIN numbers
## To find the correct PA form, it is important to have the right RX info
### RX info can be found on the correct insurance card
### RX info incudes the following information:
* ### `Bin` number
* ### `PCN` number
* ### `Group` number

---

### Most insurances are using the same RX information, so once you know one, you can re-use it for the rest (the same) insurances type.

### For some insurance you can find the correct form just by typing
#### <u>Here is an expample:</u>
We have a patient with `Aetna` insurance. His/her ID Number starts with `W`. <br/>
So, just by typing the `Aetna Commercial`, we will get the right form for this insurance type

!!! note
    It doesn't always apply like that to other insurances. <br/> So, for some additional information in regards of bin numbers follow the links below

!!! warning "Patient not found"

    In case, form is not able to either find a patient or confirm the coverage, check:

    1. Confirm the patient first and last name with the information that insurance has (use NaviNet or any other source)
    2. Confirm patient address with the information that the insurance has (use NaviNet or any other source)
    3. Confirm patient has an active pharmacy coverage with the insurance that you are trying to send a PA (patient might have another insurance or coverage for pharmacy benefits)
    4. Call the pharmacy, so they can create a PA key with the information that they have on file
